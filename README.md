Homeoholic is a puzzle / sneak game that was started in the Global Game Jam held in January of 2019. Unfortunately, we had limited manpower and the game barely was completed any further than the first puzzle, and even that one was buggy as hell.  
That is the reason why @MrVizious (Javier Riera) and @Kyru (Ferr√°n Devesa) both decided to start it again, using what they learned in those 48 hours to do it all over again, but better and without any hurry.

If anyone is interested in the **_thing_** that was made during the GGJ, you can find it [here](https://github.com/MrVizious/GlobalGameJamEnero2019) in all its glory.
